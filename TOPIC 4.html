  <h1>🤖Technological Advancements  </h1>
  <p>
    
Robotics has developed rapidly over the years due to major technological advancements in science, engineering, and computing. Modern robots are no longer simple machines; they are intelligent systems capable of thinking, learning, and adapting to their environment.

One of the biggest advancements in robotics is the use of Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Machine Learning (ML), which allow robots to make decisions and improve their performance through experience. Robots now use advanced sensors and cameras to detect objects, avoid obstacles, and navigate spaces accurately. The integration of the Internet of Things (IoT) enables robots to connect with other devices and receive real-time data, improving their efficiency.
