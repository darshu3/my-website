A humanoid robot is a type of robot designed to resemble and mimic the human body in appearance, movement, and behavior. These robots often have a head, torso, arms, and legs, allowing them to perform tasks similar to humans and interact naturally with people and environments built for human use.The first full-scale humanoid robot is widely considered to be WABOT-1, developed in 1973 by scientists at Waseda University in Japan.Sophia is a human-like robot created by Hanson Robotics in 2016, designed to simulate human expressions and interactions using advanced AI
