  <h1>🤖 AI and Autonomy </h1>
  <p>
     
Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Autonomy are two important aspects that have transformed modern robotics. AI gives robots the ability to think, learn, and make decisions, while autonomy allows them to act independently without human control.With the help of AI, robots can understand their surroundings using sensors and cameras, analyze information, and choose the best actions to complete tasks.Autonomous robots can move, plan, and work on their own in real environments.Together, AI and autonomy make robots smarter, more efficient, and capable of solving complex problems. These technologies are shaping the future of industries, healthcare, transportation, and even space exploration by reducing human effort and increasing accuracy and safety.
