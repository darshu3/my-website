  <h1>🤖 TYPES OF ROBOTICS</h1>
  <p>
    <UL>
<li>Medical robotics:Industrial robots are used in manufacturing, assembly, and other industrial processes. They are typically large, highly precise machines that are programmed to perform specific tasks such as welding, painting, and packaging. They are used to improve efficiency, reduce costs, and improve the quality of products.

</li>
<li>Industrial robotics:Service robots are used in domestic and personal settings, such as vacuuming robots and personal assistants. They are designed to assist people with everyday tasks, such as cleaning, cooking, and providing information. They are also used in healthcare and elderly care facilities to assist with tasks such as lifting and moving patients.

   </li>
 <li> Military robotics: Military robots are used in military operations, such as bomb disposal and surveillance. They are designed to perform tasks that are too dangerous for humans, such as defusing bombs and entering buildings. They are also used for reconnaissance, surveillance, and target acquisition.
  </li>
  <li>Space robotics: Space robots are used in space exploration and research. They are designed to operate in the harsh environment of space, and can be used for tasks such as repairing satellites, exploring other planets, and conducting scientific experiments.
