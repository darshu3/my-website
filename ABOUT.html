  <h1>🤖ABOUT ROBOTICS </h1>
  <p>
    Robotics is a branch of science and engineering that deals with the design, construction, operation, and use of robots.
A robot is a machine that can perform tasks automatically — either by being programmed or by using artificial intelligence (AI). Robots have become a subject of great interest nowadays involves everything from the physical structure and movement of robots to the programming and algorithms that enable them to act, sense, and process information. The goal is to create machines that can assist humans in various ways, whether by handling monotonous or dangerous tasks, improving efficiency in industries like manufacturing, or performing complex actions in areas like surgery and space explorationg precise manufacturing tasks in a modern factory setting with blue lighting">
